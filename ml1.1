.TH ML1 1 "September 2024" "Version 0.11"
.SH ML/I User's Manual -- Appendix RR
This implementation is based on version AJB of LOWL ML/I.
.LP
This manual is based on ML/I User's Manual Appendix R for UNIX.

.SH Restrictions and Additions
This implementation of ML/I contains all the features expect character
variable described in the ML/I User's Manual, 6th Edition, February
2010.

.SH Operating instructions and I/O
.IP -v
Print the version number of this implementation of ML/I.
.IP -w\ n
Set the amount of workspace available to ML/I to n words
(the default is 65536 words).
.IP -d\ file
Nominate file as the debugging file. By default, this is the standard
error stream (usually the user's terminal). The name - is taken to
mean the standard output.
.IP -o\ file
Nominate file as an output file. Up to four output files may be
specified; each must be preceded by the -o flag. If no output files
are specified, the standard output is used. An output file named - is
also taken to be the standard output.  All other arguments to ML/I are
taken to be the names of input files; there may be no more than five
of these. If no input file is specified, the standard input is
used. The name - is also taken to mean the standard input.

.SH Control of input
Input may be read from any one of the input streams; the value of \fIS10\fR
controls the selection. The possible values are 1-5 or 101-105.
.LP
If \fIS10\fR is set to a value between 101 and 105, 100 is subtracted from
that value to obtain the number of the file to be selected for input;
the modified value is also stored back into \fIS10\fR. The difference
between this and the use of values 1 to 5 is that the corresponding
file is repositioned at its start; this is useful where a set of
macros require multiple passes over a source file.
.LP
When the end of an input stream is reached, ML/I checks to see if it
is the \(dqrevert stream\(dq. If it is, the process is terminated;
otherwise input is switched to the revert stream, and processing
continues. The revert stream is initially 1; its value is held in
\fIS23\fR and may be altered by the user if required.

.SH Control of output
Output may be directed to any combination of the nominated output
files, including none at all. The values of \fIS21\fR and \fIS22\fR
control the selection; \fIS21\fR controls output to all four files,
and \fIS22\fR controls output to the second file only (this is just
for backward compatibility). Each bit in \fIS21\fR controls an output
file; the least significant bit controls the first output file (as
specified on the command line), the next bit controls the second
output file, and so on. In each case, if the bit is set it indicates
that output is to take place to the corresponding file. For example, a
value of 1 would cause output to file 1; a value of 2 would cause
output to file 2; a value of 4 would cause output to file 3, and a
value of 3 would cause output to files 1 and 2. For backwards
compatibility, a nonzero value in \fIS22\fR also causes output to file
2 to take place; the presence of this value or the presence of the
appropriate bit in \fIS21\fR will cause output to take place, although
the presence of both does not imply that output takes place twice.

.SH Use of S1-S9
.IP S1
If \fIS1\fR is one, the imaginary startline character is inserted on
input. If \fIS1\fR is zero, no startlines are inserted; this is the
initial setting.
.IP S2
The current source text line number is held in \fIS2\fR; it may be
changed at any time.
.IP S3
If \fIS3\fR is one, the error message normally generated if a warning
marker is not followed by a macro name is suppressed. If \fIS3\fR is
zero (the initial value), the message is produced.
.IP S4
If \fIS4\fR is one, the context print-out normally given after a call
of MCNOTE is suppressed. If S4 is zero, the context print-out is
given; this is the initial setting.
.IP S5
Count of processing errors.
